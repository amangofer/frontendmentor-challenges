## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://nextjs.org/) - CSS framework


### What I learned

#### Customizing your colors in Tailwind CSS
Use `@theme` to add custom colors to your project under the `--color-*` theme namespace:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@theme {
  --color-midnight: #121063;
  --color-tahiti: #3ab7bf;
  --color-bermuda: #78dcca;
}
```
Now utilities like `bg-midnight`, `text-tahiti`, and `fill-bermuda` will be available in your project in addition to the default colors.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - This provides comprehensive information on the framework, including core concepts, customizability, and how to use it effectively for web development.
